Hi! I am a research scientist at Salesforce AI Research. I am broadly interested in trustworthy AI that aligns with human values, especially in the era of agentic systems powered by LLMs. Topics that I currently focus on: 
- Understand what LLM-based systems can and cannot do—through world simulations, sandbox environments, challenging benchmarks, and evaluation protocols.
- Design and build effective and trustworthy agentic systems—agents that can use tools, process long contexts, conduct deep research, and engage in multi-turn interactions. 

I obtained my CS Ph.D. in 2024 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/index.html">Sharon Li</a>. My thesis covers a spectrum of algorithmic developments for reliable foundation models in the open world.
<!-- I am broadly interested in reliable machine learning that aligns with human values, especially in the era of multi-modal foundation models. A central theme that continually resonates with me is: How can we foster innovative algorithms and deeper understanding to ensure that our machine learning systems perform reliably in the real world?  -->
In the past, I have worked on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14852'>Spatial Reasoning for LLMs and VLMs</a> with <a href='https://xinw.ai/'> Xin Wang</a>, <a href='https://vibhav-vineet.github.io/'>Vibhav Vineet</a>, and <a href='https://neelj.com/'>Neel Joshi</a> from Microsoft Research. I also worked on <a href='https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.332/'> Multi-Modal Document OOD </a> with <a href='https://gujiuxiang.com/'>Jiuxiang Gu</a> from Adobe Research. 

<!-- algorithm design, empirical studies, and theoretical studies that investigate the principles and practices for reliable machine learning in the open-world. I have two prior internships at Microsoft Research and Adobe Research, working on improving reliability and reasoning of multi-modal vision-language and document understanding models. -->




<!-- Research topics that I currently focus on include: reliable machine learning, multimodal learning, and large language models. -->
