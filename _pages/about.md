Hi! I am a research scientist at Salesforce AI Research. I am broadly interested in trustworthy AI that aligns with human values, and agentic systems powered by large language models (LLM). In particular, 
- Understand what LLM-based systems can and cannot do—through world simulations, sandbox environments, challenging benchmarks, and evaluation protocols.
- Design and build effective and trustworthy agentic systems—agents that can use tools, process long contexts, conduct deep research, and engage in multi-turn interactions. 

<!-- Research topics that I currently focus on include: reliable machine learning, multimodal learning, and large language models. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
