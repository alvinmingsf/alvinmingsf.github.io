Hi! I am a research scientist at Salesforce AI Research. I work on agentic systems built with large language models (LLMs) and trustworthy AI. My current focus include:

- Post-training: training agents for tool use, long-context reasoning, deep research, and multi-turn interaction

- Foundational research: understanding the capabilities and limits of LLM-based systems

- Benchmarks & evaluation: building sandboxes, challenging benchmarks, and scalable evaluation frameworks
<!-- Research topics that I currently focus on include: reliable machine learning, multimodal learning, and large language models. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
