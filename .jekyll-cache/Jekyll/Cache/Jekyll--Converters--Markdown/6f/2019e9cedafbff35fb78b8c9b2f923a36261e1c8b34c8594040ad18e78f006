I"0<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am lucky to be advised by <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/index.html">Prof. Sharon Li</a>, and have collaborated with <a href="https://kangwooklee.com/">Prof. Kangwook Lee</a>. Iâ€™m broadly interested in trustworthy machine learning and representation learning.  I try to answer the question: how can we design efficient algorithms and promote fundamental understandings to enable reliable open-world learning (e.g., impact of spurious correlation, sample efficiency, and multi-modality).</p>

<p>Research topics that I currently focus on include: out-of-distribution detection, domain generalization, and representation learning.</p>
