I"x<p>I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/index.html">Prof. Sharon Li</a>. I am broadly interested in reliable machine learning that aligns with human values, especially in the era of multi-modal foundation models. A central theme that continually resonates with me is: How can we foster innovative algorithms and deeper understanding to ensure that our machine learning systems perform reliably in the real world?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #DAA520;">I will join Salesforce AI as a full-time Research Scientist this summer :) </span></strong></p>

<!-- Research topics that I currently focus on include: out-of-distribution detection, domain generalization, and representation learning. -->
