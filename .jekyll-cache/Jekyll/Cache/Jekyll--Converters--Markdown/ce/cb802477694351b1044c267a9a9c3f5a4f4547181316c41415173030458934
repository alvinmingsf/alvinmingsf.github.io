I"<p>Hi! I am a research scientist at Salesforce AI Research. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/index.html">Prof. Sharon Li</a>. I am broadly interested in reliable machine learning that aligns with human values, especially in the era of multi-modal foundation models. A central theme that continually resonates with me is: How can we foster innovative algorithms and deeper understanding to ensure that our machine learning systems perform reliably in the real world?</p>

<p>Research topics that I currently focus on include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve reasoning of contextual LLM, RAG, VLM, and Agents.</li>
  <li>Enable LLMs to generate and handle long contexts effectively.</li>
  <li>Obtain domain expert language models.</li>
</ul>
